##Inspiration
Making rap songs is my hobby but sometimes it gets really hard for me to find good beats to rap on, 
so I have to make beats by my own which is difficult and time consuming and they mostly turn out to sound bad. 

##What it does
Wexmo is the World's First Decentralized Marketplace for Buying and Selling Beats. a platform where rappers and singers can browser through a huge number of beats posted by the talented producers / beat makers around the world

here music producers can showcase their music productions skills as beginner or a professional to the whole world

##How we built it
We planned to use:
- Infura online IPFS network for Decentralised File Storage of beats
- Hedera's Blockchain for 
Metadata (titles, descriptions, pricing, ownership details, etc.)
Ownership details (smart contracts) and transaction records
- Circlerâ€™s secure wallet integration for managing financial transactions within the platform

##Challenges we ran into
building the frontend and linking it with the backend was a really challenging task as we just beginners

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
learnt a lot about web3, frontend and backend development
collaborating on this project was really fun thing to do

##What we learned
we learnt about:
- decentralized file storage
- making smart contracts using Hedera
- Integrating Circle for secure wallet to manage financial transactions

##What's next for Wexmo
- building proper backend and a proper UI for the users
- scaling it to the masses
